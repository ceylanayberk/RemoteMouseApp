# RemoteMouseApp
 This is an open-source backend(express js) and react native expo app that communicates with websockets or bluetooth.

#Installation

For both of /myapp and /backend just do 
## "npm install"
after in /backend do
## "node websocket.js"
and  in /myapp do 
## "npx expo start"
but you need expo development build to run it. Because defauld Expo GO app does not support react-native-ble-plx lib.
